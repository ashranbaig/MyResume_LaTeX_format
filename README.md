# 📘 What is LaTeX?

**LaTeX** (pronounced “Lah-tech” or “Lay-tech”) is a powerful document preparation system used to produce high-quality, professional documents — especially well-suited for resumes, academic writing, technical papers, and more.

It is **not** like traditional word processors (e.g., MS Word). Instead, you write plain-text code that defines the structure and content of your document, which is then compiled to produce a styled and formatted **PDF**.
